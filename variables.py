#A variable is created when you assign a value to it. 
name = "srinika"
age = 16
x = 15
y = 75
print(name)
print(age)
print(x*y)
print(x/y)
print(x+y)
print(x-y)
#I have printed x and y using basic arithmetic operations

#You can specify the data type of the variable through casting.
a = str(26)
#the str function just keeps the characters side by side
b = int(26)
#the int function is the integer value
c = float(26)
#the float function basically adds a decimal point to an integer
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
